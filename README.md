Introduction 

With the help of animation, we can visualize difficult mathematical concepts and make them approachable and enjoyable. This project aims to create an interactive and engaging 2D/3D animation that incorporates the 12 principles of animation to ensure realistic and smooth motion, which will improve the learning experience.

Utilized Software

1. Adobe Animate: Selected due to its extensive feature set for 2D animation creation.
2. Adobe Photoshop: For creating backgrounds and characters.
3. Adobe After Effects: Used to enhance the finished video and add additional effects.
4. Audacity: Sound effects and voiceovers can be recorded and edited with this programme.

These resources were chosen for their wide range of compatibility and ability to create animations of superior quality.

Features and Technical Specifications 

o	Adobe Animate offered an intuitive user interface for producing fluid frame-by-frame animations.
o	After Effects' timeline tool was essential for coordinating the audio and visual components.
o	Photoshop's sophisticated brush tools made it possible to create vivid backdrops and intricate character designs.
o	The noise reduction tool of Audacity made sure that audio recordings were crystal clear and of a high calibre.


Materials & Effects

To generate realistic movements,
•	Adobe Animate was used to apply motion blur and softening effects.
•	Photoshop's layer styles and filters gave the backgrounds more texture and depth.
•	After Effects particle systems and other special effects improved visual appeal.
•	The animation's immersive audio layer was enhanced by the use of royalty-free sound effects and background music.



Introspection
 
Producing this animation was a fulfilling endeavor that enabled me to utilize my abilities in a real-world setting. Synchronizing the audio with the visual components was one of the biggest challenges, requiring several iterations and painstaking attention to detail. But with the help of Adobe After Effects, I was able to improve the animation's overall quality and attain exact timing. My comprehension of the 12 principles of animation and how they apply to educational content has improved as a result of this endeavor.

Storyboard

 1. Synopsis Scene: Hello, I am Maleesha. I am the teacher of your math lesson today. We will talk about an important theory called Pythegaras Law.
2. Concept Explanation: Meet the right-angled triangle. It has one angle that is exactly 90 degrees. The sides are called the legs (a and b), and the longest side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse (c).
Pythagoras' Theorem tells us that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In mathematical terms, it's written as: 
A2 + B2 = C2
 

•	3. Application Scene: A new right-angled triangle appears with sides a = 3 units, b = 4 units, and hypotenuse c labelled as ?.

32  + 42  = C2 

9 + 16 = C2

C2 = 25 

C = 5 



4. Conclusion: Pythagoras' Theorem isn't just for solving problems on paper. It's used in real life too! Architects use it to design buildings, sailors use it for navigation, and artists use it to create perspective in their work. Keep practicing, and you'll master it in no time….
